## Introduction to DBMS

## The relational model

## Relational algebra
- unary operators: projection, selection. 
- Binary operators: union, difference, intersection, Cartesian	
	production, _natural join_, _θ-join_. Negation, _universal and existence quantification_
	  
## Database design and normalization
- Data redundancy, insertion, update, and deletion anomalies. 
- Relational theory definitions: schema, tuple instance, functional dependency, 
  legal instance, closure of F. trivial dependencies, properties of functional dependencies. 
-* Armstrong’s axioms, rules: decomposition, union, pseudotransitivity, with Theorem *proof* 
-* Closure of X and first lemma on the closure *proof*
-* Theorem F^+ = FA *proof*
- Third normal form, formal definition and alternative definition. 
-* Algorithm for computing X+, correctness theorem *proof*
- Key definition, practical ways to find the keys of a schema, uniqueness check. 
- Decomposition of a schema, definition. 
- Projection of F on the decomposition of a schema, definition. 
- Equivalence between two sets of functional dependencies, definition. 
-* Lemma on the closures of two sets of functional dependencies *proof*
- Decomposition preserving F, definition. 
	- algorithm
-* Algorithm for checking if F is preserved *proof*
- lossless join
	- equivalence check for set of fctnal dep
	- 3 Theorems of mrho(r)
	- algorithm for checking if a decomposition is lossy
- Minimal Cover
	- algorithm
