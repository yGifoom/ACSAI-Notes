## Overview of the network infrostructure
	- network edge
	- network link
		- coaxial cable
		- optic fiber
	- network core
		- packets
		- routing, store & forwarding
		- packet vs circuit switching
			- frequency division 
			- time division
	- network of networks
		- global, regional isps
	- packet loss and delay
		- transmission delay = nodal processing + queuing + transmission + propagation
		- queuing delay graph
		- throughput
	-layer model of the internet
		- encapsulation 
		- routers and switches implementing only some
		
## Application Layer
	- paradigm 
		- client server paradigm 
		- peer to peer 
		- inter process comunication
		- sockets
		- identifiers
	- transport services needed
		- data integrity
		- timing
		- throughput
		- security
	- protocols:
		- UDP
		- TCP
		### HTTP
			- request message format
			- request messages
			- stateless
			- persistent, non-persistent
			- several objects in one
			- GET & POST
			- respose status codes
			- cookies 
				- session management
				- maintaining cookies user/server
			- web caches
			- conditional GET
			- HTTP/2 
				- pushing embedded object to client
				- dynamic transmission order (round robin...)
				- framing of objects
		### Email 
			- user agents, web server
			- SMTP RFC (5321)
				- client push
				- message format
				- IMAP, SMTP
		### DNS (pushing complexity to the edge of the network)
			- IP address
			- Host aliasing (canonical and alias host names)
			- load distribution
			- hierarchy
				- root
				- top level domain
				- authoritative
			- name resolution
				- iterated query	
				- recursive query
			- DNS caching
				- records
					- type A
					- type NS
					- type MX
					-
